Greetings everyone, I am Jack Fu. Inspired by the frequent questions within the Unreal Engine community about specifiers and the use of various metas, and dissatisfied with the insufficient explanations provided in the official Unreal Engine documentation, I have compiled this document. It includes detailed explanations for over 100 specifiers and more than 300 metas. This document is continuously being maintained.

For the best experience, it is recommended to view the various markdown files on GitHub or clone them to benefit from the organized directory structure and linked navigation. For those with limited internet access, a PDF version of the e-book is also available. At the beginning of the document, there is a comprehensive table of specifiers, allowing for a quick overview of their functions. For specific specifiers, please utilize the search function to locate them.

The document is bound to have its share of omissions, errors, and inadequacies. I welcome pull requests or feedback to help improve this resource and benefit the wider Unreal Engine community.
